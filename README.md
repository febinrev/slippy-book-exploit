# Slippy-book: EPUB File Parsing Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution
### CVE-2023-44451 (Xreader), CVE-2023-52076(Atril)(Reserved): 
 RCE Vulnerability affected popular Linux Distros including Mint, Kali, Parrot, Manjaro etc. EPUB File Parsing Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution

A Critical Path traversal and Arbitrary file write vulnerability has been discovered in the default document viewer software of Linux's MATE/ and Linux Mint affecting popular operating systems such as Kali Linux, Parrot Security OS, Ubuntu-Mate, Linux Mint, Xubuntu and all the other Operating Systems that use MATE or Atril/Xreader as default doc viewer.

The vulnerability exists in Atril Document Viewer and Xreader Document Viewer which are the default document viewers of the MATE environment and Linux Mint respectively. Atril is the default document reader for Kali Linux, Ubuntu-Mate, Parrot Security OS, and Xubuntu, and Xreader is the default document reader for Linux Mint.

This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access, the only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files but that doesn't stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system. 

[+] Achieving Remote Command Execution:

This vulnerability can't be exploited to overwrite existing files, it can only create new files under any specified locations, but that doesn't stop us from achieving RCE. I tried out using the vulnerability to write a .desktop entry under $HOME/.config/autostart and then I logged out and logged back in, the malicious .desktop entry got triggered and I got Remote Command Execution. I also tried placing an authorized_keys file under .ssh/ directory and achieved RCE via SSH. 
Note: If a directory is not present it will create the directory automatically.

Who knows about the Ebook format? Hasn't everyone switched to PDF?

The answer is no, EPUB is still a popular and powerful document format, but many people prefer PDF. Most of them are familiar with PDFs. So, I was trying to maximize this vulnerability impact.
Another Interesting thing I noticed was, when renaming the .epub document to something.pdf, the vulnerable Document Viewer (Atril/Xreader) tries to open the something.pdf file and reads it as an EPUB document because it is responsible for reading both EPUB and PDF, it also supports many other document formats as well. In other words, we can rename our crafted something.epub to something.pdf and then send it to the target to achieve RCE on the target.


So everything is good, we could create an exploit that'll craft an epub/pdf pair to write malicious .desktop entries under /home/<username>/.config/autostart/ directory. But there's a small problem, the target user's username is required for successful exploitation of this bug. What if we don't know the username? No Easy RCE? Needs to guess Username? Needs to try random common usernames? Let's see what I got..

Upon further analysis, I found out that we can use the /proc/self/cwd to access the user's home directory if he downloads the crafted document and opens it somewhere inside his home directory such as the ~/Downloads/, ~/Documents/ directory. So we can exploit the path traversal bug to achieve RCE just by using the gadget ../../../../../proc/self/cwd/../.config/autostart/exploit.desktop.

I have created a fully working exploit for this vulnerability (exploit_rce.sh) and a script to write and include custom files for path traversal (exploit_file_write.sh).
