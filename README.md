# Slippy-book: EPUB File Parsing Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution
### CVE-2023-44451 (Xreader), CVE-2023-52076(Atril)(Reserved): 
 RCE Vulnerability affected popular Linux Distros including Mint, Kali, Parrot, Manjaro etc. EPUB File Parsing Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution

A Critical Path traversal and Arbitrary file write vulnerability has been discovered in the default document viewer software of Linux's MATE/ and Linux Mint affecting popular operating systems such as Kali Linux, Parrot Security OS, Ubuntu-Mate, Linux Mint, Xubuntu and all the other Operating Systems that use MATE or Atril/Xreader as default doc viewer.

The vulnerability exists in Atril Document Viewer and Xreader Document Viewer which are the default document viewers of the MATE environment and Linux Mint respectively. Atril is the default document reader for Kali Linux, Ubuntu-Mate, Parrot Security OS, and Xubuntu, and Xreader is the default document reader for Linux Mint.

This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access, the only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files but that doesn't stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system.
